            <h2>Wisp</h2>
            <p>
              Wisp is a compelling artist known for their ability to craft
              dreamy, emotionally resonant soundscapes that blend electronic
              textures with intimate, heartfelt vocals. Their music captures a
              raw sense of vulnerability, often exploring themes of identity,
              longing, and introspection. With a unique aesthetic that merges
              ethereal melodies and glitchy production, Wisp stands out for
              pushing creative boundaries while maintaining a deeply personal
              connection with listeners. Their work feels both nostalgic and
              forward-thinking, making them a standout voice in the emerging
              indie and electronic scenes.

            <h2>Kaz Moon</h2>
            <p>
              Kaz Moon (Cody Yao) stands out as a boundary-pushing multimedia
              creative: singer, producer, songwriter, photographer, and
              videographer. Based in New York after relocating from Texas, he
              first garnered attention in 2019 with his project Bleed. What
              followed were two parts of the Curses! EP (2021 and 2022), leading
              into a striking 2023 release STAR ANISE—which helped him score
              high-profile opening slots for artists like NIKI and Balming
              Tiger, as well as headline his first U.S. tour Moons artistry is
              defined by intimate vulnerability, cinematic textures, and a
              strong visual identity. He uses the vagueness of his stage name to
              let the aesthetic take shape through his work—resulting in music
              that feels otherworldly, emotional, and deeply personal. As he
              described it, he hopes listeners feel “transported somewhere else”
              when experiencing his music, making it feel like its from a
              different lifetime

            <h2>Bixby</h2>
            <p>
              bixby (Bradley Au), a Vietnamese‑American
              singer/songwriter/producer from Southern California, channels
              mainstream alt-pop with soaring falsetto melodies and effortlessly
              infectious hooks. With breakout success from his alt‑pop single
              “endlessly,” he gained the attention of Dylan Brady’s Dog Show
              imprint (part of Atlantic Records), which released his 2023 EP Are
              You Sleeping Alone Again? Known for heartfelt, relatable lyrics
              and expressive live performances, bixby blends emotional intimacy
              with polished pop production. His vocal ability and catchy hooks
              create music listeners can feel immediately connected to—while
              projects like darling, he lied, Easy, and Dying to See You show
              his range from reflective ballads to upbeat, danceable grooves .
              In short, bixby crafts music that is both deeply personal and
              highly memorable.
